First, we needed to group by the day and channel. Then ordering by the number of events (the third column) gave us a quick way to answer the first question.

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
   channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

here you can see that to get the entire table in question 1 back, we included an * in our SELECT statement. You will need to be sure to alias your table.

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
           channel, COUNT(*) as events
     FROM web_events 
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;

Finally, here we are able to get a table that shows the average number of events a day for each channel.

SELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
             channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Here is the necessary quiz to pull the first month/year combo from the orders table.

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) 
FROM orders;
Then to pull the average for each, we could do this all in one query, but for readability, I provided two queries below to perform each separately.

SELECT AVG(standard_qty) avg_std, AVG(gloss_qty) avg_gls, AVG(poster_qty) avg_pst
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
     (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);

SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd)
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
      (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);
